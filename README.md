==========================

The bot is meant to guide the process of a sales store.
It will greet the user, capture his/her name and ask for a transaction type.

Transactions / intentions handled are: Buying, selling, returning an item and managing wrong input.

## Wrong input handling
After the greeting, if the user messages an intention that's out of the scope, it will return a "Did not understand" message and restart the workflow

## Buying
## Selling
## Return
